This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects from my DataCamp learning journey.

All projects were originally created using DataCamp Workspaces and have been migrated here for version control and portfolio purposes. Each folder includes a detailed `README.md` along with its notebook, dataset(s), and visuals.

These projects helped me practice Python, data analysis, visualization, and common data science workflows.
