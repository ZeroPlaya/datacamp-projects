# Audible Dataset â€“ Data Cleaning in Python

This repository contains my work from a DataCamp Live Training focused on cleaning real-world audiobook data from [audible.in](https://www.audible.in/).

## Data Cleaning Workflow

The notebook demonstrates a complete data cleaning pipeline:

- Loaded and inspected raw audiobook data (`audible_raw.csv`)
- Cleaned text fields (`author`, `narrator`, `language`) for consistency
- Extracted and separated star ratings and number of reviews into numeric columns
- Standardized `price` values and converted currency from INR to USD
- Parsed and converted date fields (`releasedate`) to proper datetime objects
- Converted audiobook durations into total minutes (`time_mins`)
- Identified and removed duplicate records based on key attributes
- Performed summary statistics and visual checks using histograms
- Exported the cleaned dataset to `audible_clean.csv`
